**Key Concepts:** Evaluating, Current state, Identify, Opportunities, To improve

## Summary of Module 1

There is a six-step process for addressing a data analysis problem: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act. It serves to analyze the data ecosystem in order to develop data-driven decision-making, which requires analytical skills such as curiosity, understanding of context, technical mindset, data design, and data strategy, in order to use them, along with gut instinct, to guide a business decision. 

Another important aspect is analytical thinking, which consists of visualization, strategy, problem orientation, correlation and big picture thinking or detail-oriented thinking.

In addition, there are two analysis techniques: the five whys, to find the root cause of a problem, and gap analysis, which involves assessing the current state to find opportunities for future improvement.

## Data life cycle

- **Plan**: what kind of data it needed, how it will be managed throughout its life cycle, who will be responsible for it, and the optimal outcomes.
- **Capture**: data is collected from a variety of different sources and brought into the organization.
	One common method is getting data from outside resources
	company's own documents and files
	A **database** is a collection of data stored in a computer system.
- **Manage**: Care for and maintain the data. This includes determining how and where it is stored and the tools used to do so.
- **Analyze**: Use the data to solve problems, make decisions, and support business goals.
- **Archieve**: Keep relevant data stored for long-term and future reference.
- **Destroy**: Remove data from storage and delete any shared copies of the data.

There are more view of data life cycles.

**key concepts**: Plan, Capture, Manage, Analyze, Archieve, Destroy, Database.

## Data Analysis

**Stakeholder**: Who have invested time and resources into a project and are interested in the outcome.

[[#The Six Phases of Data Analysis]]

Information added:

**Ask**:

At the start of any successful data analysis, the data analyst:

- Takes the time to fully understand **stakeholder expectations**
- Defines the problem to be solved
- Decides which questions to answer in order to solve the problem

Qualifying stakeholder expectations means determining **who** the stakeholders are, **what** they want, **when** they want it, **why** they want it, and **how** best to communicate with them. Defining the problem means looking at the **current state** and identifying **the ways in which it’s different** from the ideal state. With expectations qualified and the problem defined, you can derive questions that will help achieve these goals.

**Process**:
The aim is to **refine** the data. Data analysts find and eliminate any errors and inaccuracies that can get in the way of results. This usually means:

- **Cleaning** data
- **Transforming** data into a more useful format
- **Combining** two or more datasets to make information more complete
- **Removing** **outliers** (data points that could skew the information)

## Summary of Module 2

The data lifecycle consists of six phases: planning, capture, management, analysis, archiving, and destruction. Planning involves determining how data will be managed; capturing involves collecting data from different sources; managing involves taking care of how it is used and stored; analyzing involves solving the problem; archiving involves keeping relevant data; and destroying involves deleting it.

On the other hand, as we have already seen, data analysis is based on the six phases of data analysis, and in this module, it is specified that in the Ask phase, the expectations of the stakeholders must be met; to do this, we must first see who they are and what, when, why, and how they want it. Likewise, in the Ask process, we must review the current state of the data or the problem and find the differences that separate us from what the stakeholders want. Now, for the preparation process, it is mentioned that we must refine the data by cleaning, transforming, combining, and removing outliers.

Finally, as a data analyst, you work on spreadsheets to collect data and possibly use formulas or functions; you also work on databases and query language to collect more data and manipulate it; and you also work with visualization tools to create graphs, tables, diagrams, etc.

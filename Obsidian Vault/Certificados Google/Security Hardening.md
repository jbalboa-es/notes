# OS Hardening
## Regular OS Hardening Practices
- Patch Installation
- Hardware and Software Disposal
## One-Time OS Hardening Practices
- Baseline Configuration
- Strong Password Policy
## Brute Force Attacks
- Brute Force Attacks
- Assessing Vulnerabilities
- Prevention Measures
## Countering OS Vulnerabilites
- Least privilege
- Disabling or uninstalling unnecessary programs and devices.

# Network Hardening
## Regularly Performed Network Hardening Tasks
- Firewall Rules Maintenance and Network Log Analysis
- Patch Updates and Server Backups
## Tools for Network Log Analysis
- Log Analyzer Tools and SIEM
- SIEM Dashboard and Prioritization
## One-Time Network Hardening Tasks
- Port Filtering
- Network Access Privileges and Encryption
- Segmentation
	- Isolated sub-networks
## Network Security Applications
- Firewalls
- Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFWs)
- Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
	- Logs
	- Network traffic
	- System activities
- Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)
	- Automated actions
	- Blocking malicious traffic
	- Reset connection
	- Re configuring firewalls
- SIEM tools

# Security in the cloud
- Cloud Network Security Essentials
	- Proper maintenance
	- Share responsibility
- Distinction in Cloud Network Hardening
	- Server baseline image
- Data and Application Segregation
	- Similar to OS hardening
- Security groups
	- Virtual firewalls that control inbound and outbound traffic
- Penetration testing
	- Simulated attack
- Audit testing
	- Review security polices, configurations and controls against a set of standards
## Cloud security Considerations
- Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- Configuration
- Attack Surface
- Zero-Day Attacks
- Visibility and Tracking
- Rapid Changes
## Share Responsibility Model
- CSPs
	- of infrastructure
- Organizations
	- in the cloud
## Cryptography and cloud security
### Cloud Security Hardening Techniques
- Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- Hypervisors
	- To run several different OS at the same time
### Cryptography in the Cloud
- Encryption
- Cryptographic Erasure (Crypto-shredding)
	 - Destroying the encryption keys
### Key Management
- Secure Key Storage
- Shared Responsibility
